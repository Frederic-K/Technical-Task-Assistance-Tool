## 📖 About

This application is designed to facilitate and secure financial management in the context of market operations. Initially, our starting point was a simple Excel spreadsheet used to manage and distribute budgets. However, significant areas for improvement were identified: the precision of calculations and financial distribution, as well as optimized ergonomics for a more user-friendly, simple, and intuitive experience.

2TAT is a specialized and specific business application; it is a tool for the purchasing department, seeking to optimize its financial distribution with precision and efficiency. But it is also, and most importantly, the starting point for a reflection on tools that can be developed and progressively integrated to secure and facilitate routine and technical activities.

## 🚀 Features

- Cross-platform desktop application using Tauri (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Tauri's lightweight and secure native runtime
- Modern web interface built with React (minimalistic and intuitive at this stage)
- Fast development with Vite and Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Precise decimal arithmetic with Decimal.js
- Optimized financial calculations and distribution ("penny pinching" algorithm)
- User-friendly and intuitive interface
